# SpikeSortingPCA_DBSCAN
Spike sorting implemented with principal component analysis (PCA) and density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) for extracellular differential electrode recordings. Primary functionality is analyzing mechanical stimulation experiments, but can be adapted for any type of experiment.

IMPORTANT: Tested on Matlab R2017b

IMPORTANT: The following Matlab Toolboxes are required:

Bioinformatics Toolbox, Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox, Signal Processing Toolbox, Curve Fitting Toolbox,



#Software designed to handle raw data formats exported to Matlab format from Labchart software.

IMPORTANT: Export data in the following order: Raw trace, Force Trace, Displacement Trace.

IMPORTANT: Select demo based on indenter used (GerlingIndenter, AuroraIndenter)


#Three demos are provided for each indenter:

1) Spike Sorting Demo (start here)

2) Trial Averaging Demo

3) Summary Figure Demo
